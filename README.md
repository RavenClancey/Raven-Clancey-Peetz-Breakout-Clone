Controls: 
          A - Left
          D - Right
          Space - Launch Ball
         
Multiplayer - Have one client click the host and join button, and a second click join

The sync is not as good as I'd like, but with my limited expericene with networked gameplay I think evrything fucntions to a useable standard. 

The game does not end when all bricks are broken, so just restart the game as needed.
